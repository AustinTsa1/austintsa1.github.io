# SpeechHelper
The goal of this website is to help students and even adults with timing their speeches.
Regardless of age, everyone will have to do presentations in their lifetimes and be able to convey a point across to the public within a certain time limit.
SpeechHelper will help people in rehearsing because they will be able to manage their time better and use their pauses more effectively.
